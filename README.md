# Jatt

Jatt is a fast and simple static site generator written in Go. It allows you to create and configure static websites with minimal effort. Just set up your site using the `jatt.yaml` configuration file and run the `jatt` command to build it.

## Installation

### Macos

#### Using Homebrew

```bash
brew tap devmegablaster/homebrew-devmegablaster
brew install jatt
```

### Other Platforms

1. Download and install the latest version of Jatt from the [releases](https://github.com/devmegablaster/jatt/releases).
2. Make sure `jatt` is in your system's `PATH`.

## Getting Started

1. Initialize a new Jatt project directory:

   ```bash
   jatt init
   ```

   This will create a new directory with the default `jatt.yaml` configuration file and folder structure.

2. Customize the `jatt.yaml` file as needed:

   ```yaml
   baseURL: <BASE_URL>
   title: <SITE_TITLE>
   author: <AUTHOR_NAME>
   theme: dark # or light
   contentDir: content # directory where your site content is stored
   outputDir: public # directory where the built site will be saved

   nav: #navigation menu config
     title: <TITLE> # navigation menu title
     items:
       - label: Home
         url: /
       - label: Posts
         url: /posts
       - label: About
         url: /about

   home: # home page configuration
     name: <NAME> # name to display on the home page
     description: <DESCRIPTION> # description to display on the home page
     image: <IMAGE_URL> # image to display on the home page
     social:
       - name: github
         url: <GITHUB_URL>
       - name: linkedin
         url: <LINKEDIN_URL>
       - name: <SOCIAL_MEDIA_NAME>
         url: <SOCIAL_MEDIA_URL>
     buttons:
       - name: Posts
         url: /posts
       - name: About
         url: /about
   ```

3. Build your static site:

   ```bash
   jatt
   ```

   The site will be generated in the directory specified by `output_dir`.
